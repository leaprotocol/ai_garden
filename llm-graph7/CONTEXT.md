# Project: LLM Graph 7 - Visual Node-Based LLM Interface

## Recent Changes
1. Fixed streaming functionality in LLM node:
   - Updated server to use `ollama.generate` with `stream: true`
   - Properly handles streaming chunks through WebSocket
   - Fixed connection handling between nodes

2. Added Debug Mode to nodes:
   - Added debug toggle button to each node
   - Implemented node-specific debug output panels
   - Shows progress indicators (|) and status ([complete], [error])
   - Removed console spam in favor of in-node debugging

3. Updated Documentation:
   - Documented current node implementations (LLM, Timer, Output)
   - Added planned node types section
   - Updated setup instructions for Ollama integration
   - Added debug mode documentation

4. Implemented New Node Types:
   - **LeakyBucket Node** for token accumulation and rate limiting
   - **Merger Node** for combining and summarizing content
   - Added node registration in App.jsx
   - Updated Sidebar with new node types

## Current State

### Active Components
1. **LLM Node**:
   - Connects to local Ollama instance
   - Streams responses in real-time
   - Shows debug output for token generation
   - Properly forwards chunks to connected nodes

2. **Timer Node**:
   - Generates timed events
   - Configurable interval
   - Debug mode for monitoring ticks

3. **Output Node**:
   - Displays responses and events
   - Connection validation
   - Debug mode for monitoring inputs
   - Formatted event history

4. **LeakyBucket Node** (In Progress):
   - Token accumulation with configurable threshold
   - Visual progress bar for token count
   - Debug mode for monitoring accumulation
   - Currently not receiving content from spawned nodes (Issue)

5. **Merger Node** (In Progress):
   - Combines content from multiple LeakyBucket nodes
   - Uses LLM for intelligent merging
   - Requires minimum 2 sources to merge
   - Waiting on LeakyBucket fix to test functionality

### Current Issues
1. Content Flow Problem:
   - LeakyBucket nodes not receiving content from spawned nodes
   - Connections are being made (logged in App.jsx)
   - Need to debug WebSocket message handling
   - Verify spawned node output emission

### Next Steps
1. Fix content flow from spawned nodes to LeakyBucket
2. Complete testing of Merger node functionality
3. Implement remaining planned nodes:
   - **Condition Node** - For flow control and event filtering
   - **Memory Node** - For maintaining context and state
   - **Data Source Node** - For external data integration

The system has been expanded with new node types for token accumulation and content merging, but requires debugging of the content flow between spawned nodes and LeakyBucket nodes. The core streaming LLM capabilities and debug features remain functional.

# LLM Graph Project Context

This document provides context about the LLM Graph project, its current state, and recent changes.

## Recent Changes and Current State

### Recent Changes
1. Standardized event system implementation
   - Created base event interface with fields: id, type, timestamp, source, metadata, content
   - Implemented helper functions for creating events (chunk, completion, error)
   - Updated nodes to use standardized events (LLM, LeakyBucket, Spawner)

2. Test Framework Setup
   - Installed Mocha and Chai for testing
   - Created test files for LeakyBucket, LLM, and Spawner nodes
   - Added test scripts to package.json

3. Documentation
   - Added comprehensive event system documentation to README.md
   - Documented event structure, types, flows, and best practices
   - Included examples and future enhancements

### Current Issues
1. Ollama Request Cleanup
   - Problem: Ollama requests continue generating after client disconnection
   - Added AbortController but cleanup not working as expected
   - Added logging to track abort calls and request states

2. LeakyBucket Tests
   - Some tests failing related to event buffering and leaking mechanisms
   - Need to review and fix event handling

### Next Steps
1. Debug Ollama request cleanup
   - Verify AbortController implementation
   - Check Ollama library's cancellation support
   - Consider alternative cleanup approaches

2. Fix LeakyBucket tests
   - Review event buffering logic
   - Fix event leaking mechanisms
   - Update tests for new event structure

3. Continue standardizing events
   - Implement in remaining nodes
   - Add more test coverage
   - Update documentation as needed

### Technical Details
1. Event Structure
```typescript
interface Event {
  id: string;          // Unique event ID
  type: string;        // Event type
  source: string;      // Source node ID
  data: any;          // Payload
  meta?: {            // Optional metadata
    parent?: string;  // Parent event ID
    seq?: number;     // Sequence number
    done?: boolean;   // Completion marker
  }
}
```

2. Main Event Types
- chunk: Partial content from streaming
- complete: Sequence completion
- error: Error events
- spawn: Node creation
- remove: Node removal
- tick: Timer events
- state: State changes

3. Active Development Files
- llm-graph7/server/server.js
- llm-graph7/test/nodes/*.test.js
- llm-graph7/README.md

### Environment
- OS: linux 6.8.0-48-generic
- Shell: /usr/bin/zsh
- Workspace: /home/undefined/Projects/ai_garden
