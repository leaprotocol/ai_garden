# Exploring Bidirectional Context in Language Models: A Journey Through Token Prediction

## Introduction

In our recent exploration of language model behavior, we embarked on a fascinating journey to understand how models utilize context in both forward and backward directions. This blog post details our experiments, findings, and insights into the nature of contextual dependencies in language models.

## The Evolution of Our Investigation

Our investigation evolved through several stages, each building upon the insights from the previous:

1. We started with basic token prediction and probability analysis
2. Moved to the LAMBADA dataset for long-range dependency testing
3. Experimented with BERT's masked token prediction
4. Analyzed token presence patterns
5. Finally developed a comprehensive bidirectional analysis framework

## Key Experiments

### 1. LAMBADA Dataset Evaluation

We began by testing model performance on the LAMBADA dataset, which is specifically designed to evaluate long-range dependencies. Our initial findings showed:

- Models struggled with long-range context (average probability < 0.1)
- Proper nouns and domain-specific terms were particularly challenging
- Comparison with SmolLM models revealed interesting patterns in prediction confidence

### 2. BERT Masked Prediction

Moving to BERT-based masked prediction, we found:

- Better handling of bidirectional context
- More confident predictions for common words
- Interesting patterns in how context length affects prediction

### 3. Token Presence Analysis

Our analysis of token presence revealed:

- 85% of target words appeared somewhere in their input context
- Single-token targets were more common (82%) than multi-token ones (18%)
- Average context length was about 83 tokens

### 4. Bidirectional Analysis Framework

The culmination of our research was a comprehensive bidirectional analysis framework that revealed:

- **Asymmetric Dependencies**: Words often showed different probability patterns when predicted from left-to-right vs right-to-left
- **Context Impact**: Full context vs neighbor-only comparisons showed the importance of long-range dependencies
- **Surprising Patterns**: Some words exhibited unexpectedly high probabilities in specific contexts while remaining low probability in others

## Technical Implementation

Our final analysis tool (`demo6.py`) includes several innovative features:

```python
def analyze_sequence(model, tokenizer, words):
    """Analyze a sequence from both directions."""
    forward_results = []
    backward_results = []
    
    # Forward analysis (left to right)
    for i in range(len(words)):
        # ... analyze forward context
        
    # Backward analysis (right to left)
    for i in range(1, len(words) + 1):
        # ... analyze backward context
        
    return forward_results, backward_results
```

We implemented:
- Probability tracking for both directions
- Neighbor-only vs full-context comparison
- Statistical analysis of probability distributions
- Visualization of bidirectional influences

## Key Findings

1. **Contextual Asymmetry**
   - Forward prediction often showed different patterns than backward prediction
   - Some words were more predictable in one direction than the other

2. **Context Length Impact**
   - Long-range context significantly improved prediction accuracy
   - Neighbor-only context was often insufficient for accurate prediction

3. **Surprising Words**
   - We identified words that showed unexpectedly high probabilities in specific contexts
   - These often included domain-specific terms and proper nouns

4. **Statistical Patterns**
   - Forward predictions showed higher variance in probabilities
   - Backward predictions were often more confident but less accurate

## Visualization and Analysis

We developed a color-coded visualization system:
- Red indicating backward prediction confidence
- Green showing forward prediction confidence
- Combined colors revealing bidirectional influences

Example output:
```
(0.12,0.05|2.4)word(0.08,0.03|2.7)
```
This format shows:
- Full context probability
- Neighbor-only probability
- Ratio between them
- For both forward and backward predictions

## Future Directions

Our experiments suggest several promising directions for future research:

1. Investigating why certain words show asymmetric prediction patterns
2. Analyzing how different model architectures handle bidirectional context
3. Exploring applications in model evaluation and training

## Conclusion

This investigation has provided valuable insights into how language models utilize context in both directions. The asymmetric nature of contextual dependencies and the importance of long-range context suggest that current evaluation methods might need to be expanded to better capture these aspects of model performance.

Our tools and findings provide a foundation for future research into contextual dependencies in language models and might inform the development of more sophisticated evaluation metrics and training approaches.
