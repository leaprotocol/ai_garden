Operations are actions performed on or with states. Key operations include:

- **Creation:** Initializing a new state with a model and initial text.
- **Generation:** Extending a state by generating new tokens.
- **Forward:** Processing text through a state without generating new tokens.
- **Analysis:** Inspecting the state's internal data, such as attention patterns and token probabilities.
- **Modification:** Updating a state's configuration or history (planned).
- **Forking:** Creating a copy of a state.
