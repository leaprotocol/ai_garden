## `benchmark.js`

The provided file is a script designed to benchmark a local language model (LLM) server using a REPL-based user interface created with the Blessed library. Here's a breakdown of its components:

1. **Imports**:
    - `screen`, `createThreadBox`, and `logToConsole` are imported from a `ui.js` module, which likely handles the UI setup for displaying thread outputs and logging to the console.
    - `createThread` is imported from `websocketThread.js`, which handles the WebSocket communication with the server.
    - `bazosctrlc`, `exampleText1`, and `lslah` are imported from `example_texts.js`, presumably containing example texts used in the benchmarks.

2. **Threads Setup**:
    - The script defines two example threads, each with a system prompt and a user prompt, which are used to generate Linux commands based on provided content.

3. **Benchmarking Loop**:
    - The script initiates multiple requests (`noRequests = 5`) to the server to measure response times.
    - Each request uses the `createThread` function to send a prompt and receive a response. The responses are collected in `resultArray`.

4. **Performance Measurement**:
    - The script calculates the total time taken to complete all requests and logs the average time per request.

5. **User Interface**:
    - The UI allows users to view ongoing benchmarks and interact with the system, exiting with standard key commands like 'q', 'Ctrl+C', or 'Esc'.

In summary, this script benchmarks a language model's response times by sending multiple prompts, measuring the time taken for each, and displaying the results in a Blessed-based UI.
